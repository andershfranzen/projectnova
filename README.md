# ProjectRS

A multiplayer browser MMORPG inspired by RuneScape Classic and HighSpell. Built with Bun, TypeScript, and Babylon.js.

## Features

- **3D World:** Chunk-streamed terrain with heightmap elevation, vertex-colored tiles, variable-height walls, roofs, floors, stairs, and linear fog
- **Building System:** Edge-based thin walls, elevated floor platforms, 4-step stair ramps, flat and peaked roofs — all configurable per tile
- **Multi-Map:** 1024x1024 overworld with distinct regions + 256x256 underground dungeon, connected by transition tiles
- **Multiplayer:** Server-authoritative with dual WebSocket protocol (binary game + JSON chat)
- **Combat:** OSRS-style tick-based combat with hit chance, max hit, 4 melee stances, equipment bonuses
- **Skills:** 12 skills with OSRS XP formula — 6 combat + 6 gathering/crafting (forestry, fishing, mining, cooking, smithing, crafting)
- **World Objects:** Harvestable trees (3D models), rocks, fishing spots + crafting stations (furnace, cooking range, altar)
- **Items:** 30 items — weapons, armor, food, skilling resources, processed bars
- **Persistence:** SQLite saves player position, inventory, skills, and map level
- **Map Editor:** Full-featured visual editor with tools for tiles, heights, walls, floors, stairs, roofs, NPC/object placement, undo/redo, copy/paste, export/import

## Overworld Regions

| Region | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Central Village | Stone plaza, 7 buildings, guards, shopkeeper, farm with chickens |
| NE Mountains | Rocky peaks, copper/iron rocks, wolves, mining camp |
| E Forest | Dense trees, spiders, wolves, oak trees for high-level forestry |
| SE Ruins | Stone ruins, skeletons, Dark Knight boss, dungeon entrance |
| SW Goblin Camp | Dirt camp with tents, 10 goblin spawns |
| NW Swamp | Water/sand mix, rats, fishing spots |
| River & Coast | Water from NW to south coast, sand banks, fishing spots |

## Tech Stack

- **Server:** Bun + TypeScript
- **Client:** Vite + Babylon.js 7 (WebGL)
- **Editor:** Vite + TypeScript (2D canvas-based map editor)
- **3D Style:** Low-poly terrain with 2D billboard sprites + 3D models (GLB)
- **Protocol:** Binary WebSocket (opcode + int16 values)
- **Maps:** PNG-based (heightmap grayscale + tilemap RGB) + walls.json for building data

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Generate map files
bun tools/generate-maps.ts

# Build client
cd client && bunx vite build && cd ..

# Start server
bun server/src/main.ts

# Open http://localhost:4000
```

### Development (hot reload)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Server
bun run dev:server

# Terminal 2: Client (vite dev server on :5173, proxies /ws and /api to :4000)
bun run dev:client

# Terminal 3: Editor (vite dev server on :5174)
bun run dev:editor
```

## Building System

Buildings are defined in `walls.json` per map using an edge-based wall system:

- **Walls:** 4-bit bitmask per tile (N/E/S/W edges) with configurable height per tile
- **Floors:** Elevated walkable platforms at any Y height, rendered with edge faces
- **Stairs:** 4-step ramps connecting height levels, with configurable direction (N/E/S/W)
- **Roofs:** Flat or peaked (N-S or E-W ridge), rendered at configurable height

Player height automatically follows floors and interpolates along stairs via `getEffectiveHeight()`.
